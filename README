  What is it?
  -----------

  EMBuilder is a model building program for cryo-electron microscopy(cryoEM)
  density maps. It is based on template matching method which is widely used
  in Crystallography. The suitable resolution for input map is higher 
  than 3.5 Angstrom.

  Installation
  ------------

  Short version: Download & run.
  Long version: EMBuilder was pre-compiled as a portable Linux binary. It 
  will work with modern x64 Linux distros. A set of templates and references 
  are required for EMBuilder. All default templates and references are in 
  "struc_lib" folder. The path of "struc_lib" folder should be assigned by 
  exporting it to $EMB_LIB_PATH. Otherwise, "struc_lib" folder should be in 
  the current folder(./) of the running command.

                                           before model building
  -refine-only ()                        : Only refine voxel size, don't 
                                           build model("-refine-vox" is 
                                           required)
  -refine-out-prefix (voxel_refined.map) : Output prefix of voxel size 
                                           refined EM map
  -out-inter-models ()                   : Output intermediate models 
                                           after every cycle

  Examples
  --------

  1. Build main chain of a cryoEM map(EM.map, 3.2A) with threshold=0.5,
     residues=2000 and default reference(EMD-8194):
      $ EMBuilder -i EM.map -o model.pdb -t 0.5 -r 3.2 -b 2000

  2. Build main chain and side chain of a cryoEM map(EM.map, 3.2A) with 
     threshold=0.5, residues=2000, sequence file=sequence.fasta and 
     default reference(EMD-8194):
      $ EMBuilder -i EM.map -o model.pdb -t 0.5 -r 3.2 -b 2000 -sidechain 
        -seqin sequence.fasta 

  3. Refine the voxel size and build main chain and side chain of a cryoEM 
     map(EM.map 3.2A) with threshold=0.5, residues=2000, sequence 
     file=sequence.fasta, new reference(EMD-2984, 3.0A) and a partial 
     model(partial.pdb): 
      $ EMBuilder -i EM.map -o model.pdb -t 0.5 -r 3.2 -b 2000 -sidechain
        -seqin sequence.fasta -ref-map-in EMD-2984.map 
        -ref-pdb-in EMD-2984.pdb -ref-resol 3.0 -wrk-pdb-in partial.pdb
        -refine-vox

  4. Only refine the voxel size of a cryoEM map(EM.map, 3.2A) with 
     threshold=0.5, residues=2000:
      $ EMBuilder -i EM.map -t 0.5 -b 2000 -refine-vox -refine-only

  Troubleshooting
  ---------------

  1. ERROR: "file" does not exist! Please check file or export 
     $EMB_LIB_PATH or put struc_lib into current folder.
   *) Check whether the "file" is exist.
   *) Export the location of "struc_lib" folder to $EMB_LIB_PAT:
       $ export EMB_LIB_PATH=/location/of/struc_lib
   *) Or put the struc_lib into the folder where you run the program. 

  2. WARNING: -ref-map-in or -ref-pdb-in is missing, both ignored.
   *) Only the map or the pdb of reference was provided. The program needs
      them both. Please use "-ref-map-in" and "-ref-pdb-in" at the same time.

  3. WARNING: Working map is too small to simulate, llk target funciton may 
     be inaccurate. Try using a smaller reference.
   *) The number of valid sampling of reference map in Fourier space is less 
      than the one of working map. Therefore, the accuracy of map simulation 
      can't be ensured, which leads the inaccuracy of llk target function 
      and poor model building results. The solution is using a smaller 
      reference(smaller grid sampling than working map) as the input files. 

  4. WARNING: number of helices/strands for voxel size refinement < 20.
   *) Before voxel size refinment, the program will identify the position
      of helices and strands in the input map. The top 20 helices and strands
      will be used to adjust voxel size. If this WARNING appeared only once,
      maybe the map is nearly full helices or strands. The accuracy of voxel
      size refinement will not be affected. If this WARNING appeared twice,
      maybe the resolution of the map is not enough to identify helices or 
      strands. In this situation, the accuracy of voxel size refinement 
      can't be ensured.
